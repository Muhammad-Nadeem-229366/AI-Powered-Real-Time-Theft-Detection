# AI-Powered-Real-Time-Theft-Detection

## Overview

This project aims to detect suspicious and theft-related activities in shopping malls using AI techniques applied to CCTV surveillance data. The system is modular, scalable, and designed for real-time analysis.

## Current Status

#### Phase 1: Problem Statement & Literature Review 

#### Phase 2: System Design & Data Understanding (In Progress)

## Objectives

- Analyze CCTV video streams for human activity

- Extract meaningful features such as pose, motion, and temporal patterns

- Detect suspicious behavior in real time

- Generate alerts and visualize events on a dashboard

## Planned System Modules

- CCTV Video Ingestion & Processing

- Feature Extraction (pose, motion)

- Temporal Behavior Analysis

- Backend API & Data Management

- Alerting System & Frontend Dashboard

## Design Philosophy

- Modular pipeline for easy model upgrades

- Real-time or near real-time processing

- Extensible for future improvements

### Note

The specific AI models and algorithms will be finalized after experimental evaluation and testing.
